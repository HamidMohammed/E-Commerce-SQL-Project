## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end SQL data engineering workflow using a denormalized e-commerce dataset.

The work includes:

- Full normalization to **Third Normal Form (3NF)**
- Data quality validation and conflict detection
- Production-style ETL pipeline
- Primary and Foreign Key enforcement
- Advanced analytical SQL queries
- Window functions for time-series revenue growth analysis

The goal of this project was not only to write SQL queries, but to design and implement a robust relational database system from a raw flat file.

---

## 🧱 Database Architecture

### 🔹 Raw Layer
- `raw_table` — Flat CSV import containing 39 columns from multiple entities

### 🔹 Normalized 3NF Schema
The dataset was decomposed into the following entities:

- `customer`
- `seller`
- `product`
- `orders`
- `shipping`
- `order_item`
- `payment`

All tables include:

- Proper Primary Keys
- Foreign Key constraints
- Cascading rules where appropriate
- Correct data types

---

## 🔄 ETL Strategy

The ETL process includes:

### ✅ Data Quality Diagnostics
- Duplicate detection using `GROUP BY`
- Conflict detection for composite keys
- Validation of payment consistency
- Handling denormalization artifacts

### ✅ Conflict Resolution
- `DISTINCT` used where safe
- `GROUP BY` aggregation used where required (e.g., payment duplicates)
- Deterministic rules using `MAX()` for collapsing duplicate rows

### ✅ Referential Integrity
- Enforced foreign keys
- Controlled loading order to avoid FK violations

## 📊 Business Analytical Queries Implemented

The project answers the following business questions:

1. Top 10 customers by total spending  
2. Total revenue per seller state  
3. Top 5 sellers by revenue  
4. Monthly revenue trend  
5. Top 5 product categories by number of orders  
6. Customers with more than 3 orders  
7. Orders with highest freight-to-product price ratio  
8. Payment method distribution (percentage)  
9. Average delivery time per state  
10. Top 3 product categories by month-over-month revenue growth  

Advanced SQL concepts used:

- `COUNT(DISTINCT)`
- `DATEFROMPARTS`
- `LAG()` window function
- `ROW_NUMBER()`
- `SUM() OVER()`
- Defensive aggregation logic

---

## 🧠 Advanced Highlight: Revenue Growth Using Window Functions

Month-over-month revenue growth per category was calculated using:

- Monthly aggregation
- `LAG()` for previous month comparison
- Growth computation
- Ranking logic

This demonstrates analytical SQL capability beyond basic aggregation.
